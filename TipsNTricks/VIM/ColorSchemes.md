## Color Schemes
Let's face it. VIM without color schemes is quite ugly. So, let's change that.

### How to choose and enable?
Selecting and applying a color scheme in VIM is rather easy. You just need to
have the required wanted scheme file in the `~/.vim/colors` folder, then just
select it in your `~/.vimrc` file by typing `colorscheme YOUR_COLOR_SCHEME_NAME`
and it'll be enabled for you.

### Where to get schemes?
There are lots of color schemes over the internet, but a nice compilation of
them can be found [here](https://github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes). Just
install the plugin with your plugin manager of choice, and you're ready to use 
any of the schemes listed in the repository just as if you had installed it
individually.

You can try any color scheme at "runtime" by typing `:colorscheme YOUR_SCHEME`
while in the editor. Find the one you like, then edit the `.vimrc` file to
enable it always ðŸ˜‰
