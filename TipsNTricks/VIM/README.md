## Tips N Tricks on the VIM editor
Over here you'll find a series of tips and tricks regarding the VIM editor. But,
first of all, it'd be nice to know why such editor is useful, provided that it's
so complicated and unituitive to operate, and its UI is not the best.

### Why use it?
For starters, VIM is available in all platforms, so you can use it wherever you
are coding at the moment. It's got lots of support and... it's **REALLY**
powerful ðŸ’ª

With VIM, you can do just about **anything**. Coding, scripting, writing poems,
books, letters, internet rants... whatever you'd like. And it's prepared for it,
there are lots of amazing plugins you can add to your editor to make it work
just as you'd like. You can edit its color schemes... Anyway, you get the idea.

### How to start?
The best way to make your way to mastering VIM is probably by using the
`vimtutor`. It's a command that's most probably already installed in your
computer (and if not you can simply install it, you can use 
`brew install vimtutor` if you're working in OSX) and will guide you through a
very basic crash course that'll get you started with the editor. It is
recommended that you save up 30 minutes or so prior to starting it, as it can
take a bit of time, but it is worth it. You can always do it by bits instead of
all at once, that's ok too.

### Where to continue?
After you've done VIM tutor, it's really a matter of practice and how much you
investigate and delve into the editor and its features. But, here are some more
documents that talk about some functionalities and plugins which you might find
useful.

- [Useful VIM Plugins](UsefulVimPlugins.md)
- How to change your color scheme
- The MOST useful VIM command
- Enabling VIMs native spell-checker
- What's a <leader>, and what to do with it?
- Using macros
- Generally unuseful but COOL VIM features

### Resources
As well as the documents above, you may also find my 
[.vimrc](../Resources/.vimrc), a configuration file that configures the editor 
each time it's opened. You can use it to get new ideas for configurations that
suit your typing style and make the editor much more useful to you.
