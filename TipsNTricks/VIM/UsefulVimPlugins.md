## Useful VIM Plugins
Even though VIM is formidable by itself, it's when you add in some plugins when
the editor really starts to shine.

To do so, you can use several plugin managers. I personally use 
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), but you can use any other you 
prefer.

### NERDTree - File Drawer
So, maybe you'd like to jump from file to file without the need of exiting VIM.
Well, you can do so with this plugin.

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is an in-VIM File Explorer 
that allows you to do several file management operations without the need of 
exiting the editor. Just map a set of keys to open it up and a neat drawer 
listing the files in the directory will popup on the left-side of the editor. I 
personally have it mapped to `<leader> k`, but you can use anything that works 
best for you (check [this](Leader.md) out if you don't know what a `<leader>` 
is).

I suggest reviewing my [NERDTree config](../../Resources/.vimrc) if you'd like
to have nice icons and Git support included with the plugin.

### Powerline - Nice bottom status bar
A great visual addition to the editor is 
[Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline). I suggest you just check
their repository for details, but it's a quite nice visual change.
